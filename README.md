# Virus Collection: A Repository of Varied Viruses

Welcome to the Virus Collection repository. This curated collection features a compilation of viruses created by different individuals, including myself.

# How to Use
 
Please note that these viruses have been thoroughly tested and are known to function efficiently. However, it is important to exercise caution and refrain from testing them on your personal computer. Most of the viruses, with the exception of those found in the "joke" folder, pose a significant risk. Additionally, avoid testing them on a virtual machine, as these viruses can potentially compromise the main operating system connected to it.

Included in this collection are .apk viruses designed specifically for Android devices. These viruses can establish a connection between the victim's device and your own, enabling the theft of sensitive information. Remember that .apk viruses should be sent to the victim's private IP address's localhost URL, similar to how Metasploit functions.

Furthermore, there are .exe viruses intended for use on computers. These viruses should also be sent to the victim's computer for proper operation.

Some viruses within this collection are unique files, tailored for specific occasions. Although they may require compilation using the appropriate compiler software, they are straightforward to use.

Finally, be aware that one of the files included is a Discord stealer capable of extracting extensive information beyond just the Discord token. Similar to the other viruses, this particular file must be sent to the victim's computer.

# Warning

It is important to emphasize that I bear no responsibility for any actions performed with these viruses. Any usage of these viruses is solely at your own risk. Proceed with caution and exercise ethical judgment
